README:

 A small game of the "Snake" or "Worm" type for the gameboy. Try to eat as much as you can, whilst not eating yourself or throwing you in the walls.

 - Use the arrow keys to start the game, or resume it after a pause

 - Use the arrow keys to move the snake

 - Use the buttons to pause the game, restart the game, or change levels


 8 levels are included. For those who don't like the wraparound, level 4 mimics the classic game without it.


Bugs/Todo (in no particular order):
 - If you hold an button, then release it, it will not go to the other direction you might hold
 - Save highscore somewhere where it won't be erased by a power cycle
 - Sound cuts off when restart
 - Make the code a bit more procedural
 - Unmess the code for restarting
 - Add powerups like 5 point cherries
 - Improve the In/Outgame menu
